    /// is meant to be a demonstration on how to use the Utility Network portions of the SDK.  The report display is rudimentary.  Look elsewhere in the SDK for better examples on how to display data.

    /// Rather than coding special logic to pick a starting point, this sample leverages the existing Set Trace Locations tool that is included with the product.
    /// That tool writes rows to a table called UN_Temp_Starting_Points, which is stored in the default project workspace.  This sample reads rows from that table and uses them as starting points
    /// for our downstream trace.
