# ArcGIS Pro Utility Network SDK

The utility network in ArcGIS provides organizations that manage networks – like electric, telecom, gas, sewer, and water lines – an extensible solution that focuses on performance, scalability, interoperability, and data integrity. 

This repository is no longer in active use.  Most of the utility network documentation and samples have been integrated in with the [ArcGIS Pro SDK](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/sdk/).  This repo contains some documentation that may be useful to partners.  It may be used in the future for additional pre-releases of the utility network.

## Documentation
The [wiki page](https://github.com/esri/utility-network-sdk/wiki) contains a single document document:

- [SDK Changes](https://github.com/esri/utility-network-sdk/wiki/SDK%20Changes).  For those partners who were part of our alpha or beta programs, this document describes what classes and methods changed with each pre-release.
